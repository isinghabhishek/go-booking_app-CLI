Creating a ticket Booking App Command Line Interface(CLI) using Go language.
The basic syntax of Golang is similar to other C-style languages, but there are some important differences to be aware of. Golang is a statically-typed language, which means you need to declare the type of each variable when you define it. Golang also uses curly braces to define blocks of code, and semicolons are optional at the end of each statement.

Golang has a simple and concise syntax that is easy to learn. Here are the basic syntax elements of Golang:

- Variables: Variables in Golang are declared using the var keyword followed by the variable name and the data type. For example: var age int = 30.

- Data Types: Golang has several built-in data types, including integers, floats, strings, booleans, arrays, slices, maps, and structs.

- Control Structures: Golang has the standard control structures found in most programming languages, including if statements, for loops, switch statements, and defer statements.
